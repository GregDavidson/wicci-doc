* New Wicci Roadmap

** Big Steps

Technical
- Automate the required custom PostgreSQL build
- Get the Wicci Database to build with the latest PostgreSQL
      - With all tests passing
- Make sure the Database can save the Wicci State
- Create an impressive demo website
- Restore the Wicci Module system
      - It is currently dead code
- Design and Automate Wicci System versioning
- Expand the kinds of documents the Wicci can support
      - Including working towards the Wicci containing itself
- Create more impressive Wicci websites

Non-Technical
- Create a not-for-profit corporation to own the Wicci
      - Possibly also owning LOEL
- Get ambitious designers using the Wicci
- Become financially sustainable
- Create synergy with LOEL
      - The Wicci is the LOEL infrastructure
      - LOEL Learners improve the Wicci

** Strategy

Consider adopting a Tick-Tock development model, inspired by Intel.

Tick steps are upgrades in the quality and power of the underlying system.
Making the future better. Library improvements for the front end. Schema
improvements for the back end.

Tock steps are improvements in the user interface and convenience features. Web
interfaces becoming nicer (with less effort because of preceding Ticks).

** Smaller Steps

More Technical
- Improving code everywhere
      - Cleaner, simpler, smaller, more maintainable
      - Refactoring, eliminating cruft, modernizing
- Better testing and automation
- Improving documentation
- Make the system need less documentation
      - By making it more general and more consistent

Less Technical
- Create Presentations
      - Demos, Videos
